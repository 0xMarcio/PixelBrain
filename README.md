# PixelBrain

Welcome to the PixelBrain - PyTorch CIFAR-10 Image Classifier repository! This project is focused on building and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. It's designed to be a resource for anyone interested in learning about applying CNNs in image classification using PyTorch.

## Introduction
The CIFAR-10 dataset comprises 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate a CNN using PyTorch on this dataset. This project is suitable for learners at all levels, from beginners to advanced users looking to brush up on their skills.

## Features
- Detailed Jupyter notebooks explaining each step of the process.
- Modular Python scripts for easy understanding and modification.
- Visualization tools to inspect the performance of the model.
- Best practices in model development and evaluation.
- Extensive comments for code clarity.

## Installation
To get started with this project, you'll need to set up a Python environment and install the required libraries. Here's a quick rundown:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/0xMarcio/PixelBrain.git
   cd PixelBrain
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
After installation, you can run the scripts or explore the Jupyter notebooks:

1. **Jupyter Notebooks**: 
   - `01_Data_Preparation.ipynb`: Notebook for data loading and preprocessing.
   - `02_Model_Building.ipynb`: Notebook explaining the CNN architecture.
   - `03_Model_Training.ipynb`: Training the model on CIFAR-10.
   - `04_Model_Evaluation.ipynb`: Evaluating the model's performance.

2. **Python Scripts**: 
   - `train.py`: Script to train the model.
   - `evaluate.py`: Script to evaluate the trained model on test data.
